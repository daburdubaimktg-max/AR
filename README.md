# AR Stickers

A browser-based AR sticker camera. No install, no build step — just open it on your phone.

- **Face stickers** — tap a sticker while your face is in view and it snaps to a spot (crown on your head, shades on your eyes, nose on your nose…) and follows your face as you move and tilt.
- **Free stickers** — turn *Face lock* off to drop stickers anywhere in the scene.
- **Your own stickers** — "+ Your sticker" adds any image (transparent PNGs work best).
- **Move / resize / rotate** — drag with one finger, pinch and twist with two. On desktop: drag, scroll to resize, Shift+scroll to rotate.
- **Capture** — the shutter button snaps a photo with the stickers baked in; save or share it.
- **Front/back camera** switch.

Face tracking uses [MediaPipe Face Landmarker](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker), running entirely on-device. Nothing is uploaded.

## Try it

The camera only works over HTTPS (or `localhost`).

**On your phone (GitHub Pages):** in the repo go to *Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source* and pick **GitHub Actions**. The `Deploy to GitHub Pages` workflow then publishes the site on every push; the URL appears in the workflow run.

**Locally:**

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

## Files

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | Page layout and controls |
| `style.css` | Styling |
| `app.js` | Camera, face tracking, sticker placement, gestures, capture |

Add built-in stickers by editing `PRESETS` in `app.js`. Each has an emoji and a face placement (`x`, `y`, size `s`) measured in eye-widths from the bridge of the nose.
